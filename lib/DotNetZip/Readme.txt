The Ionic.Zip.dll library is not from the official project, but rather a fork from here: https://github.com/haf/DotNetZip.Semverd.

Reason for using this fork currently is that the official project is not compatible with Mono on Linux/Mac yet - Until that happens we use the fork. 


Some important notes to future updates:


- Latest custom build is from August 31, 2011.

- The official version the fork is based on is (v1.9.1.8): http://dotnetzip.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/changes/81674

- The version the current dll is compiled from this commit https://github.com/haf/DotNetZip.Semverd/commit/a3680f73470dacbb2cd15155fa09198f1c811f6d
