Bottles Overview
=====================

Bottles is the spawn of a random conversation between Jeremy Miller and I. 
It started out with me asking "Is wanting something like Jars, but for .net,
crazy?" and after some back and forth we both agreed that it wasn't completely
stupid. So the idea continued to stew in my head, and to my surprise the next
time we talked Miller had actually started working on it for FubuMVC. Now that
I am at Dovetail I am working to have a bottle-aware Windows Service host 
that runs on Topshelf. This host will live in the Bottles repository and 
should provide a convenient way to host these types of services.
