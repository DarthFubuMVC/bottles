Bottles and NuGet
=================

Whenever I describe bottles it often seems that people think that I shoul
be using NuGet or OpenWrap instead, however 'Bottles != NuGet or OpenWrap'
I hope that from the above you can see that, now that being said there is
no reason why a Bottle couldn't be bottled up as a NuGet package or an
OpenWrap for simple delivery, 'Bottles and NuGet/OpenWrap are besties.'
